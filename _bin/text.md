You should have a good\nunderstanding now of how to make maps with OpenStreetMap. What else can\nyou do with OSM? How can you learn more? How can you stay connected to\nthe community of mappers?\n\nOpenStreetMap Tools\n-------------------\n\nIn this guide we have learned the building blocks of OSM, and the tools\nyou need to contribute to the map. But because the data on OSM is open,\nit has encouraged many more projects and tools that allow you to do more\nwith the OpenStreetMap map.\n\nMapOSMatic\n----------\n\nOne such project is called MapOSMatic, which you can access through your\ninternet browser at [maposmatic.org](http://www.maposmatic.org/). This\nis a simple tool for printing a map of any area you choose. It will\nautomatically create the map, along with a grid over the map, and an\nindex of locations that are included in the area.\n\nLearn More\n----------\n\nThere is a lot of information about OpenStreetMap available at\n[wiki.openstreetmap.org](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/). Here you can\nfind information about other projects that are related to OpenStreetMap,\nand documents and tutorials that can help you learn more about OSM.\n\nMailing List\n------------\n\nThe best way to get connected to the OpenStreetMap user community is to\njoin your local mailing list. Many people sign up, using their email\naccounts to the OSM mailing list. Once you are on the list, you can send\nan email to the group if you have a question or want to talk about\nOpenStreetMap.\n\n-   To sign up for your country\'s mailing list, open your internet\n    browser and go to\n    [lists.openstreetmap.org](http://lists.openstreetmap.org/).\n\n-   Scroll down the page to find the list associated with your country.\n    The country lists are named "Talk-lg", where lg represents the\n    country of that list. For example, "Talk-id" is the list for\n    Indonesia.\n-   Click on the list you want to join.\n-   Enter the following information in the boxes on this page:\n\n    -   your email address\n    -   your first name\n    -   a new password\n    -   repeat the password\n\n-   When you are finished, click Subscribe.\n-   Now you need to open your email, just as you did when you signed up\n    for OpenStreetMap in chapter 2. There will be a confirmation email\n    in your inbox from the mailing list.\n-   Click on the confirmation link, which looks like this:\n\n-   You should now be a member of the mailing list.\n-   Now when you want to send a message to the list, you can send it to\n    [talk-id@openstreetmap.org](mailto:talk-id@openstreetmap.org),\n    replacing "id" with the country for your list. You will also receive\n    emails when other members send a message to the list.\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nThese are some of the ways that you can use and stay connected with the\nOpenStreetMap community and learn more. We hope you\'ll continue\nexploring and learning more about OSM, and contribute to the project.\nHappy Mapping!\n',
  '0200-12-01-edit-josm.md': '---\nlayout: doc\ntitle: Editing OpenStreetMap with JOSM\npermalink: /en/beginner/josm\nlang: en\ncategory: beginner\n---\n\nEditing OpenStreetMap with JOSM\n===============================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nIn Chapter 3 you installed JOSM and began drawing your first points,\nlines, and shapes. You added presets to these objects in order to attach\ninformation about them. By the end, you were able to draw your own map\nin JOSM.\n\nDrawing maps in Chapter 3 was an exercise to learn JOSM and learn how to\ndraw places on the map. But our maps were not accurate, because we\nhadn\'t yet included location. In the past two chapters we\'ve examined\ntwo tools, GPS and Walking Papers, which allow us to collect actual\nlocations of places. These locations are represented by coordinates.\n\nDrawing a real map, that is, a map where all the points, lines, and\nshapes are in their proper location, is no different than drawing the\nmaps we drew in chapter 3. But now, we will use our GPS points and\ntracks, and our Walking Papers, to draw similar maps at their correct\nlocations on the planet.\n\nIn this chapter we will learn how to edit the map on OpenStreetMap and\nadd our improvements. We\'ll learn the basic cycle of mapping on OSM:\n\n1.  **download** the current map data from OSM\n2.  **edit** it using GPS, Walking Papers, and notes as a guide\n3.  **save** changes to OpenStreetMap\n\nBy the end of this chapter, we will be able to see our additions on the\nOSM map.\n\nPrepare JOSM\n------------\n\n-   To start JOSM, click on the Start Menu in the lower left corner of\n    your computer, and find the program JOSM.\n-   Now load your gpx file and you Walking Paper. You don\'t need to open\n    both, but you can if you want. Refer to the previous two chapters if\n    you don\'t remember how to open these in JOSM.\n\nDownload OSM Data\n-----------------\n\n-   Remember the cycle of editing OpenStreetMap described in the\n    introduction of this chapter? **Download, edit, save.** Before we\n    can edit the map, we must download the existing OSM data in our\n    area.\n-   When you open your gpx track or Walking Paper, the map window will\n    show what you have opened, and will automatically move to the\n    correct coordinates. After you open your files, look in the bottom\n    left corner of JOSM. You can see the latitude and longitude\n    (coordinates) of your mouse cursor.\n\n-   Because our map window is already showing the area that we want to\n    edit, it is easy to download the OpenStreetMap data for this area.\n    Click on "File" in the top left corner of JOSM and click "Download\n    from OSM". This will open up the download window. You can access\n    this window more simply by clicking on the download button, shown\n    here:\n\n-   When the download window opens, you should see a map with a pink box\n    drawn on it. If you don\'t see the map, click on the tab marked\n    "Slippy map".\n\n-   The pink box represents the area of the map that we would like to\n    download for editing. Unless you have moved the map window since you\n    opened your GPS file or Walking Papers, the box should be drawn\n    around the correct area. However if you would like to download a\n    larger area, you can draw a new box. To draw a new box, click on the\n    map, hold your left mouse button down, and drag your mouse to create\n    a box. Release the mouse button to finish drawing the box.\n-   When you are satisfied with the size and location of the box, click\n    "Download" at the bottom of the window. JOSM will get the data for\n    this area from OpenStreetMap and open it in your map window for\n    editing.\n\nEdit\n----\n\n-   The next step is to edit the map and add new items. This is not\n    always easy at first, but with practice you will get better and\n    better.\n-   If you want to move a point, line, or shape, use the **select\n    tool.** Click on an object and drag it where it should be. This can\n    be used to correct the location of items that have been put in the\n    wrong place.\n\n-   Use the **draw tool** to draw new points, lines, and shapes.\n    Describe these objects by selecting from the Presets menu, as you\n    did in Chapter 3.\n-   Remember that your GPS points and your Walking Papers don\'t\n    automatically go\n-   into OpenStreetMap. You need to add them to the OSM map digitally,\n    using the draw tool. But your points, tracks, and Walking Papers can\n    be seen in the background as a guide.\n-   Let\'s assume that you saved a waypoint on your GPS named 030, and\n    you wrote in your notebook that 030 is a school. To add this point\n    into OpenStreetMap, you should select the draw tool, and\n    double-click on top of point 030 in your map window. This will\n    create a point. Then go to the Presets menu, and find the preset for\n    school. Enter the name of the school and click "Apply Preset". Do\n    the same to add lines and shapes.\n\nUpload Changes\n--------------\n\n-   After you have made a couple of changes to improve the map, let\'s\n    save those changes to OpenStreetMap. To save the changes, we need to\n    be connected to the internet, because we are in fact uploading the\n    changes to OpenStreetMap.\n-   Click "File" on the top menu, and then click "Upload Data". This\n    will open up the upload window. You can access this window more\n    simply by clicking on the upload button, shown here:\n\n-   The window that appears shows a list of the objects that you are\n    adding and the objects you are modifying or deleting. In the box at\n    the bottom you are asked to provide a comment about the changes that\n    you are making. Type in here a description of your edits.\n\n-   Click "Upload Changes".\n-   If this is your first time saving changes to OpenStreetMap, you will\n    be asked for the username and password that you created in Chapter\n    2. Enter them in the window that appears. If you check the box in\n    this window, your username and password will be saved and you won\'t\n    need to enter them again in the future. Click "Authenticate".\n\n-   You will need to wait a few seconds for your changes to be uploaded,\n    and then you are done! You have made your first edits to\n    OpenStreetMap. You may continue editing to add all your points if\n    you wish. Always be sure to upload your changes before you close\n    JOSM.\n\nSee Your Changes on the Map\n---------------------------\n\n-   Open your internet browser and go to\n    [openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/).\n-   Move the map to the area that you edited.\n-   You should see your changes now appearing on the map! If you don\'t,\n    try pressing CTRL+R to refresh the web page. Sometimes the map\n    doesn\'t update properly and needs to be reloaded.\n-   What if you don\'t see your changes? Don\'t worry – it may take a few\n    minutes for the changes to be shown on the map. Also, check your\n    additions in JOSM to make sure that you added them correctly. A good\n    general rule is, if your point has an icon in JOSM, then it should\n    be seen on the main map at the OpenStreetMap website.\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nNow that you\'ve seen how to add to OpenStreetMap, what\'s next? Remember\nthat OSM maps get better and better over time. Every time you make\nimprovements to the map, those changes remain and the data gets better\nand better. And just as you can improve other people\'s work, so they can\nimprove your work too.\n\nIn the next chapter, we will go over some more advanced JOSM techniques.\nWe\'ll learn how to draw better shapes, how to use different tools, and\nwhat all the buttons and windows are surround the map!\n',
  '0200-12-05-edit.md': '---\nlayout: doc\ntitle: Advanced Editing\npermalink: /en/beginner/josm-advanced\nlang: en\ncategory: beginner\n---\n\nAdvanced Editing\n================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nIn the previous chapters you have learned how to draw points, lines, and\nshapes in JOSM, how to open your GPS waypoints and tracks in JOSM, and\nhow to download, edit, and upload your changes on OpenStreetMap. In this\nchapter, we will describe in more detail some of the features of JOSM,\nso that you can beyond the simple editing tools and have a better\nunderstanding of the software. Note that while this chapter is not\nextremely advanced, it is a step higher than the previous chapters. If\nyou don’t feel like you fully understand the lessons leading up to this,\nyou may wish to practice a little bit more before continuing.\n\nA Tour of JOSM\n--------------\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_tour.png)\n\n-   JOSM has many different features. The main window in JOSM you are\n    already familiar with – this is the map window, and it is where most\n    of the action takes place. Here you view, edit, and add to the\n    OpenStreetMap data.\n-   To the right of the map window are a series of panels, which each do\n    something different. Typically when you first install JOSM several\n    panels are shown by default, such as Layers, Properties, and\n    Selection. When you select a point, line, or shape in the map\n    window, it will be shown in the Selection panel. Information about\n    the object will be shown in the Properties panel, and the username\n    of the author of that object will be shown in the Authors panel.\n-   On the left side of JOSM, there are several toolbars, which consist\n    of many buttons. At the top of this bar are different buttons which\n    change what you can do with your mouse. You are already familiar\n    with the first two, the Select tool and the Draw tool. The other\n    tools make it easier to zoom in, delete an object, draw a shape, or\n    create a line that is parallel to another line.\n-   Below these tools are many more buttons. These buttons control what\n    you see on the right side of JOSM. Using these buttons you can open\n    and close the boxes on the right, such as properties, selection, and\n    author.\n\nJOSM Layers\n-----------\n\n-   Open your GPS file and download data from OpenStreetMap, if you\n    haven’t already. You may notice that when you open a file, or add\n    Walking Papers, or download from OpenStreetMap, another item is\n    added to the Layers panel on the right side of JOSM. Your Layers\n    panel may look something like this:\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_layers.png)\n\n-   Each item in this list represents a different source of data that\n    you have open in your map window. In the example above, “Data Layer\n    2” is the OpenStreetMap data that we want to edit. “Markers” are the\n    waypoints from the GPS, and “30 Juni 2011.gpx” is the track from the\n    GPS. Finally, “Walking Papers” is the layer created when I added my\n    Walking Paper into JOSM. You can add the Bing imagery layer, which\n    shows satellite imagery, by clicking “Imagery” on the top menu of\n    JOSM and selecting “Bing Sat.”\n-   To hide one of these layers, select one of them with your mouse and\n    click the Show/Hide button that looks like this:\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_hide.png)\n\n-   You should see the layer that you selected disappear in the map\n    window. Click Show/Hide again, and it will reappear.\n-   You can close a layer by selecting it and using the delete button:\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_delete.png)\n\n-   Lastly, it’s important to know that you can only edit the layer that\n    is considered active by JOSM. If you are unable to edit the map in\n    your map window, it’s probably because you don’t have the correct\n    layer set as active. Most layers, such as GPS points, Walking\n    Papers, and satellite imagery, can’t be edited. The only layers that\n    can be edited are data from OpenStreetMap, which are usually called\n    “Data Layer 1”.\n-   To make a layer active, select it in the Layers panel, and click on\n    the Activate button:\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_layer_active.png)\n\nSaving OSM files\n----------------\n\n-   Sometimes after you download some OSM data, you may wish to save it\n    so that you can edit it offline, and then upload it later when you\n    have internet access again.\n-   To save an OSM file, make sure that it is the active layer in the\n    the Layers panel. Click “File” on the top menu, and click “Save”.\n    Choose a location for the file and give it a name. You can also save\n    by clicking this button:\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_save.png)\n\n-   You can now close JOSM and your data will be saved. When you want to\n    open the file again, simply open JOSM, go to the “File” menu, and\n    click “Open…”\n\nAdditional Drawing Tools\n------------------------\n\n-   JOSM has some additional tools to make it easier to draw lines and\n    shapes. These tools are found in the “Tools” menu at the top of\n    JOSM.\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_tools.png)\n\n- In order to apply the functions in this menu, you must first select a\npoint, line or shape in the map window. Some of the most useful\nfunctions are described here: Split Way This allows you to divide a line\ninto two separate lines. This is useful if you want to add different\nattributes to different parts of a road. To use this function, select a\npoint in the middle of the line that you want to split, Select Split Way\nfrom the Tools menu, and your line should be split in two. Combine Way\nThis does the opposite of Split Way. To combine two lines into a single\nline, they must share a single point. To use this function, select both\nlines that you want to combine. You can select more than one object by\nholding the SHIFT key on your keyboard and clicking on each line. When\nyou have selected both lines, select Combine Way from the Tools menu.\nReverse Way This will change the direction of the line. If your line\nrepresents a road that is one way, you may want to change its direction.\nIn other cases, direction doesn’t matter. Simplify Way If your line has\ntoo many points in it and you’d like to make it simpler, this will\nremove some of the points from a line. Align Nodes in Circle If you are\ntrying to make a circular shape, draw the circle as best you can and\nthen select this function. It will help arrange your points in a circle.\nAlign Nodes in Line This function will align a series of points into a\nstraight line. Orthogonalize Shape This function is very useful for\ndrawing buildings. After you draw a building, this function will reshape\nit to have square corners.\n\nTags\n----\n\n-   When you draw a point, line, or shape, it is create with a location,\n    but no information about what it is. In other words, we know where\n    it is, but not what it is. Before now, we have been using items from\n    the Presets menu to define what it is.\n-   The way OpenStreetMap knows what an object is is by using tags. A\n    tag is like a label that you can put on something. For example, if I\n    draw a square, it’s only a square. But then I add multiple tags to\n    it that describe what it is:\n    -   this square is a building\n    -   the name of the building is “Menara Thamrin”\n\n    - the building is 16 levels high\n-   You can add as many tags as you want to an object. Tags are saved as\n    pairs of text, called the keys and the values. In OpenStreetMap, the\n    tags written above would in fact be:\n    -   building = yes\n    -   name = Menara Thamrin\n\n    - building:levels = 16\n-   If you select an object in JOSM, you can see all the tags that are\n    attached to it in the Properties panel on the right.\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_tags.png)\n\n-   You can add, edit, and delete these tags from this panel. The tags\n    are traditionally in English however, so it is often better to use\n    the Presets menu.\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n------------------\n\n-   Sometimes it can be annoying to click over and over to select\n    different options and menus in JOSM. Luckily there are shortcut keys\n    on the keyboard that allow you to do many common tasks. Here is a\n    list of some of the most commonly used shortcut keys, along with\n    what they do:\n-   s: Choose the Select tool\n-   a: Choose the Draw tool\n-   z: Choose the Zoom tool\n-   + (plus): Zoom In\n-   - (minus): Zoom Out\n-   p: Split Way\n-   c: Combine Way\n-   o: Align in Circle\n-   l: Align in line\n-   q: Orthogonalize (make a shape square)\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nAs you can see there are many additional features that make JOSM a\npowerful tool for making maps. Remember that the more you practice with\nthese tools, the better you will become at adding information to\nOpenStreetMap.\n\nIn the final chapter we will step away from JOSM, and look at some\ninteresting projects that use OpenStreetMap data, and learn how you can\ncontinue learning about OSM.\n',
  '0200-12-10-papers.md': '---\nlayout: doc\ntitle: Using Walking Papers\npermalink: /en/beginner/walking-papers\nlang: en\ncategory: beginner\n---\n\nUsing Walking Papers\n====================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nIn this chapter we will see how we can record the coordinates of places\nwithout a GPS. We will use a tool called Walking Papers, which allow you\nto print a map of an area, draw on it and add notes, and load the paper\nback into JOSM, where you can add your locations to OpenStreetMap.\n\nOverview of Walking Papers\n--------------------------\n\nBefore we walk go into detail about Walking Papers, let\'s look at an\noverview of how the process works:\n\n**Step 1:** Locate the area you want to map on the Walking Papers\nwebsite. Print out a map of this area. You can choose to print the\ncurrent map of the area on OpenStreetMap, or you can choose to print\naerial imagery, if it is available in your area.\n\n**Step 2:** Use your printed map to survey the area. Add more places by\ndrawing them on the map. Draw lines for roads, shapes for buildings, and\nso forth. Write notes about each location directly on the map, or write\nnumbers on the map that relate to numbers in your notebook, where you\ncan write more detailed information about each object.\n\n**Step 3:** Scan your paper into the computer. If you don\'t have a\nscanner, you can take a photograph of the paper, if your camera is able\nto take high quality pictures. Upload the image to the Walking Papers\nwebsite.\n\n**Step 4:** In JOSM, load the Walking Paper. Use the objects you draw as\na reference to add them digitally into OpenStreetMap.\n\nHow does Walking Papers work?\n-----------------------------\n\nIf you follow the Walking Papers process described above, you will be\ncollecting accurate geographic coordinates of places with nothing more\nthan paper. How is this possible?\n\nWhen you print a Walking Paper, the paper comes with a square barcode on\nthe bottom of the page. This bar code allows Walking Papers to determine\nthe exact location of the map that you are using to survey. Later, when\nyou load the paper back into JOSM, all the objects that you drew will be\nin shown in their actual locations, or at least quite close, which is\ngood enough for us.\n\nNow let\'s learn how to create and use Walking Papers.\n\nCreate and Print\n----------------\n\n-   Open your web browser – this may be Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or\n    Internet Explorer.\n-   In the address bar at the top of the window, enter the following\n    text and press Enter:\n    [walking-papers.org](http://walking-papers.org/)\n-   The website should look something like this:\n\n-   Scroll down the page using the wheel on your mouse, or by dragging\n    the scroll bar on the right side of the page. Stop when you see the\n    map, as shown here:\n\n-   The map that you see shows the area that you would like to print on\n    paper. You can move the map the same way you move the map on the\n    OpenStreetMap website, using your left mouse button to drag the map\n    East or West, and your scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the map.\n    Left-clicking on the + and – buttons in the upper left corner will\n    also zoom in and out.\n-   Just above the map is a search box with a "Find" button next to it.\n    You can use this to search for a location and move the map there\n    automatically. Try typing the name of your village or town inside\n    the box, and click "Find". If Walking Papers finds the location you\n    typed, the map will automatically move there.\n-   Just below the map are some additional options. The first option is\n    labelled "Orientation." This allows you to change the size and\n    orientation of your printed map. Try changing this by clicking in\n    the box next to "Orientation" and selecting "Landscape (A4)". You\n    should see the size and shape of the map change to be wide, and\n    sized to be printed on A4 size paper.\n-   Click on the box next to the word "Provider:" Here you can select\n    from different options that will change how the map looks. Most of\n    the options show different styles of map, such as thinner lines, or\n    different colors and text. Click on "Bing Aerial Imagery" and\n    instead of a map you will see imagery provided by Microsoft of the\n    location you are viewing. Note that not all locations are covered by\n    high quality imagery, so what you see may be blurry, and not very\n    useful for making maps!\n-   Make sure that the map shows the area that you want to map. Even\n    after you search for your location, you may want to move the map\n    around to choose the right area. When you zoom in and out of the\n    map, you are changing what are called "zoom levels", which is simply\n    a way of saying how close you are zoomed in. When you are zoomed as\n    far away as possible and you can see the whole Earth, you are at\n    zoom level 0. When you zoom in as far as you can go you are at zoom\n    level 18. The current zoom level is shown just above the map.\n    Usually zoom level 15, 16, or 17 is good for making Walking Papers.\n-   Let\'s make the print now! If you have found the area you are\n    interested in mapping and have selected the options that make your\n    paper look good, you are ready. Click the button labelled "Make",\n    just below the map.\n-   You will see a new page which says that your print is being\n    processed. When it is finished, you will see your print on this\n    page. It usually take anywhere from a few minutes up to twenty\n    minutes for a print to be completed.\n\n-   When your print is ready, click "Download map PDF for print". The\n    Walking Paper should begin downloading.\n-   When the download is finish, open the PDF file. Connect your\n    computer to a printer and print the page. If everything goes well,\n    you should now have your map printed on paper.\n\nMap with Walking Papers\n-----------------------\n\n-   Take your Walking Paper outside, and use it as a guide to walk and\n    identify new places that are not on the map.\n-   Draw lines for roads, shapes for buildings, and so forth. Write\n    notes about each location directly on the map, or write numbers on\n    the map that relate to numbers in your notebook, where you can write\n    more detailed information about each object.\n\n-   When you are satisfied with your additions on the paper map, then\n    you can add them digitally into OpenStreetMap.\n\nScan and Upload\n---------------\n\n-   Walking Papers are very useful for mapping with nothing more than\n    paper, but they are not 100% magic. We will still need to add our\n    paper into JOSM, add our information digitally, and save our changes\n    on OpenStreetMap.\n-   The first step is to scan your Walking Paper into your computer. You\n    can do this by attaching a scanner to your computer, scanning the\n    paper, and saving it as an image file. If you don\'t have a scanner,\n    you can take a photography of the paper, but you should be carefuly\n    to take a very good photo. Make sure that the paper is flat and your\n    camera is directly in front of it. Be sure to include the barcode in\n    the image, as Walking Papers will not work without it. Here is an\n    example of a scanned/photographed image:\n\n-   Once you have your walking paper scanned and saved on the computer,\n    open your web browser and return to walking-papers.org, just as\n    before.\n-   Click on the "Upload" tab.\n\n-   Click "Browse..." and navigate to the file where you\n    scanned/photographed your Walking Paper.\n-   Click "Send."\n-   It may take a few minutes for your paper to upload, depending on the\n    speed of your internet connection. When the upload finishes, you\n    will see a new page with a couple questions about your scan.\n\n-   Next to the question, "Do you plan to edit this yourself?" select\n    "No". This will make your paper public, so that other mappers can\n    see it too.\n-   In the empty box at the bottom, describe what you mapped. This might\n    include the location and the types of objects that you added.\n-   Click "Save." Your Walking Paper will begin to process. This may\n    take 20 minutes or more. If you made your paper public by selecting\n    "No" on the previous page, you can close your internet browser and\n    return to it later when it has finished processing.\n\nOpen in JOSM\n------------\n\n-   When your scan has finished processing, you can load it into JOSM\n    and use it to add your information to OpenStreetMap. Return to the\n    Walking Papers website, by typing\n    [walking-papers.org](http://walking-papers.org/) in your web\n    browser, just as before.\n-   Click "Scans".\n-   Find your paper from the list, and click on it. You should see\n    something like this:\n\n-   To load the paper into JOSM, we need to copy the ID of the Walking\n    Paper you have scanned. In the URL bar at the top of your internet\n    browser, select the text and press CTRL+C on your keyboard to copy.\n    The text should look similar to this:\n    [http://walking-papers.org/scan.php?id=fmxcgdqd](http://walking-papers.org/scan.php?id=fmxcgdqd)\n-   Now open JOSM. In Chapter 3 we installed the Walking Papers plugin,\n    which allows us to see our scan. If you don\'t have Walking Papers\n    installed, go back to Chapter 3.3 for instructions on how to\n    install.\n-   On the top menu of JOSM, Click "Walking Papers". Then click "Scanned\n    Map..."\n-   Press CTRL+V on your keyboard to paste the text that you copied from\n    the Walking Papers website.\n-   Click OK.\n-   If all went well, you should see your Walking Paper load into JOSM.\n    In the next chapter, we will see how to add the places that you\n    mapped into OpenStreetMap.\n\nRepeat!\n-------\n\n-   After you add your changes to OSM, they will finally be saved on the\n    map. Then the next time you want to improve the map, you can print\n    out a new Walking Paper which will include the changes that you\n    made. As this process is repeated, the map will get better and\n    better, the more you map!\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nCongratulations! In this chapter you learned the process of using\nWalking Papers and how they work. You learned how to print, map, and\nscan a Walking Paper. In the next chapter, we will learn how to add the\nplaces that we mapped into OpenStreetMap, and you will have learned the\ncomplete process of editing the map.\n',
  '0200-12-15-gps.md': '---\nlayout: doc\ntitle: Using the GPS\npermalink: /en/beginner/gps\nlang: en\ncategory: beginner\n---\n\nUsing the GPS\n=============\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nIn this chapter we will see what a GPS does and how it works. You will\nlearn how to operate a GPS, and how to use it to create maps. In this\nchapter we will explain how to operate the Garmin eTrex Vista HCx, a\ncommon GPS used for mapping. There are many other models of GPS which do\nthe same thing, so if you are working with a different one, don’t worry\n– the principles remain the same.\n\nWhat is GPS?\n------------\n\nA GPS is like a mobile phone, except that instead of receiving radio\nsignals from telephone companies, it receives signals from satellites\nthat are going around the Earth. By receiving these signals from the\nsatellites, a GPS is able to calculate your exact location on the\nplanet. It records this location in coordinates, which are two long\nnumbers. One number tells you how far East or West you are – this is\ncalled longitude. The second number tells you how far North or South you\nare – this is called latitude. Every place on Earth has unique\ngeographic coordinates.\n\nFor example: -8.639298 Latitude, 116.311607 Longitude is a location in\nLombok, Indonesia.\n\n![Google Earth software, showing coordinates of a place in Lombok,\nIndonesia ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/lombok_map.jpeg)\n\n![Garmin eTrex Vista HCx ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/garmin_etrex.jpeg)\n\nTurn on the GPS\n---------------\n\nBefore you turn on your GPS, go outside where you have a clear view of\nthe sky. Because the GPS determines your location by receiving signals\nfrom satellites, it won’t work indoors. On the right side of your GPS,\npress and hold the Power button. The GPS will start, and it will show\nyou the Satellites page. You should see something like the image below.\nYour GPS is looking for satellite signals. When it has connected to\nthree or more satellites, it will have your location.\n\n![Once your location is determined, the Satellite screen will disappear\nand you will see the main menu. ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/aquiring_satellites.jpeg)\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/GPS-main.jpeg)\nNavigate the GPS\n----------------\n\n-   The GPS has different screens and menus that allow you to do\n    different things. To switch between screens, press the button marked\n    “X”, just above the power button on the right side of the device.\n    This button also serves to go back. If you press something by\n    mistake and would like to cancel or go back, press the “X” button.\n-   By pressing the X button, you should be able to flip through\n    different screens that will look something like this:\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/aquiring_satellites.png)\n\n-   If you return to the Satellites page, you can see that you are\n    connected to three or more satellites. In the upper left corner are\n    your coordinates, your latitude and longitude.\n-   Flip to the Map page, and you can see a map of where you are. If you\n    have added OSM maps to your GPS, you may see roads and places.\n    Otherwise, the map may look quite blank. Zoom in and out by pressing\n    the up and down arrow buttons on the left side of the GPS.\n\nTracks and Waypoints\n--------------------\n\nYour GPS records two kinds of information that are useful for creating\nmaps or saving the coordinates of a place. First, it allows you to save\nyour location in the memory of the GPS. When you save a location, the\ncoordinates will be saved with a name. For example, your first saved\npoint will be named 001, the second 002, and so on. When you save a\npoint, you can write down the number on a piece of paper, along with a\nnote about what it is, any any attribute or indicators you would like to\nknow. Saved locations on your GPS are called waypoints.Second, your GPS\ncan save what are called tracks. While a waypoint only saves a single\nlocation, a track will save a series of locations wherever you move. For\nexample, the track will record your location every one second, or every\none meter, and the result will be a series of dots that show the path of\nwhere you have been. Tracks are useful for mapping objects that are\nrepresented by lines or shapes, such as the course of a road, or the\nshape of a field.\n\n![A GPS can record a single point as well as a path of where you travel.\nHere the points are numbered in the order they are recorded. The path,\nor “track”, is shown in red. ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/gps_google_earth.jpeg)\n\nSave Your Location\n-----------------------------------\n\n-   To save your current location as a waypoint, click the “X” button\n    until your reach the Main Menu. Using the joystick, move it so that\n    “Mark” is highlighted on the screen. Push the joystick button down\n    to open the “Save Waypoint” page.\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/save_location1.jpeg)\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/save_location2.jpeg)\n\n-   You can see on this page some information about the waypoint that\n    you are saving. First is the name. If this is your first waypoint,\n    it probably reads “001”. This is the number you should record on\n    paper along with the information you want to collect with this\n    object. Next you will see the time and date when the point is\n    recorded. Below that are the coordinates, followed by the altitude.\n-   Use the joystick to move to the “OK” button at the bottom of the\n    screen. Press the joystick button down to save this point. Be sure\n    to write down the number of the point, along with what the place is\n    and any other information you want to record about the place in your\n    notebook.\n-   Press the “X” button to go to the map page. You should now see your\n    point on the map.\n\nTurn on the Track Log\n---------------------\n\n-   Now that we have learned how to save points, let’s learn how to turn\n    the track log on and off. When the track log is turned on, it will\n    automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the\n    log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished.\n    You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the\n    path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road,\n    it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the\n    road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and\n    any other important information about the road.\n-   To turn on the track log, click the “X” button until your reach the\n    page that says Track Log.\n\n![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/turn_on_track.jpeg)\n\n-   If you would like to empty the track log to delete earlier\n    recordings, use the joystick to select “Clear”, and press the\n    joystick down. The bar at the top should read “0%”\n-   To turn on the log, move the joystick to highlight “On”, and press\n    the joystick down. The track log is now recording your path.\n-   Press the “X” button to go to the map page. As you move you will see\n    your track shown as a series of dots.\n\nCopy Waypoints and Tracks to the Computer\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAttach GPS to the Computer\n--------------------------\n\n-   When you are finished mapping with the GPS you will want to copy the\n    points and tracks to your computer so that you can open them in\n    JOSM. First, turn off the track log on your GPS, by going to the\n    track page and selecting “Off”.\n-   Attach the GPS to your computer with the cable. One end should plug\n    into your computer’s USB port, and the other goes into the back of\n    the GPS, beneath the rubber flap at the top. The GPS should be\n    turned on to copy the points and tracks.\n\nInstall GPS Drivers\n-------------------\n\n-   You may need to install GPS drivers on your computer. If you have a\n    copy of USBDrivers\\_23.exe on your computer, double-click it and\n    install.\n-   If you don’t have this file, you can download it. Open your internet\n    browser and go to:\n    [http://www8.garmin.com/support/download\\_details.jsp?id=591](http://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=591)\n\n- Click “Download” to get the installation file. Locate it on your\ncomputer, and double-click to install. Get the GPSBabel Setup Program\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n- GPSBabel is a program that allows us to copy data from the GPS. If you\nhave a copy of GPSBabel on a CD or usb flash drive, you can skip to\nsection 7.4. - If you don’t have GPSbabel already, open your web browser\nand go to www.gpsbabel.org - Click “Downloads” at the top of the page. -\nScroll down the page. If your computer uses Windows, you want to\ndownload the installation file for Windows. Click\n“GPSBabel-1.4.2-Setup.exe”. The file will be downloaded to your\ncomputer. Install GPSBabel \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n- Locate the GPSBabel setup file on your computer. Double-click it to\ninstall. - Click “Next”. - Click “I accept” and “Next”. - Continue\nclicking “Next” until the program installs. - When the program has\nfinished installing, click “Finish” to start GPSBabel.\n\n![GPSBabel Interface ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/gpsbabel.png)\n\nCopy Tracks and Waypoints\n-------------------------\n\n-   Click in the circle next to the word “Device” at the top of the\n    window.\n-   In the dropdown menu labelled “Format”, select “Garmin serial/USB\n    protocol”\n-   Go down to the middle of the window, under Output. In the dropdown\n    menu labelled “Format”, select “GPX XML”:\n\n![Choose GPX XML ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/gpx_xml.png)\n\n-   Click “File Name” and type a name for your saved file. It should be\n    something that describes the data, such as the date and the\n    location. For example, jakarta-07-07-2011\n-   Make sure your GPS is connected to the computer and turned on.\n-   Click “Apply” in the bottom right corner of the window.\n-   If all goes well you should see a bar move across the screen,\n    indicating that the data is being retrieved from the GPS. When it is\n    finished, your points and track will be saved in the file that you\n    selected. Open in JOSM \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \n-   Now open JOSM. On the top menu, click “File” and then click “Open…”\n-   Find and select the file that you created with GPSBabel. Click “Open”.\n-   You should now see your points and tracks loaded into JOSM.\n\n![GPS Files Open in JOSM ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/gps_open_josm.png)\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nCongratulations! You should now have an understanding of how to use the\nGPS. If you haven’t already, practice saving points of some important\nlocations. In this chapter you learned how to open your points and\ntracks in JOSM. In Chapter 6, we will use this information to add new\nplaces to OpenStreetMap.In the next chapter, we will learn about Walking\nPapers, which is another way of collecting information for\nOpenStreetMap. With Walking Papers, all you need is paper and a pen, and\nyou can collect the coordinates of places just like with a GPS.\n',
  '0200-12-20-start-josm.md': '---\nlayout: doc\ntitle: Getting Started With JOSM\npermalink: /en/beginner/start-josm\nlang: en\ncategory: beginner\n---\n\nGetting Started With JOSM\n=========================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nIn this chapter we will learn step by step how to download and install\nJOSM, the Java OpenStreetMap editor. We will change some of the settings\nin JOSM to make it easier to use. Then we will open a sample map and\nlearn some of the basic operations of the software. Remember in chapter\n1 when we asked you to draw a map of your town or village? We will\nconclude this chapter by drawing your map again, this time digitally.\nAfter this you should have a good understanding of how to draw maps in\nJOSM.\n\nVideos Related to this Chapter\n------------------------------\n\nWe\'ve created a video that goes through some of the material in this\nchapter. [View it on YouTube\nhere.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRqn-S9maL0)\n\nDownload JOSM\n-------------\n\n-   If you have a copy of JOSM on a CD or usb flash drive, you can skip\n    to section 2, Install JOSM.\n-   If you don\'t have JOSM already, or want the newest version, open\n    your web browser – this may be Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or Internet\n    Explorer.\n-   In the address bar at the top of the window, enter the following\n    text and press Enter: josm.openstreetmap.de\n-   You can also find this website by searching for "JOSM".\n-   The website should look something like this:\n\n    ![JOSM Website ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_website.png)\n\n-   If you have Windows installed on your computer, click "Windows JOSM\n    Installer" to download JOSM. If you have a different operating\n    system, click on the link for your system. Your download should\n    begin. In this chapter we will assume that you are using Windows,\n    but the instructions are similar for other operating systems.\n\nInstall JOSM\n------------\n\n-   You may have problems installing JOSM if Java is not already\n    installed on your computer. If you have problems in this section,\n    try downloading and installing Java. You can download it here:\n    [http://www.java.com/en/download](http://www.java.com/en/download)/\n-   Find the JOSM install file on your computer. Double-click it to\n    begin setup.\n-   Click ‘OK\', ‘Next\', ‘I Agree\', and ‘Install\'. When the installation\n    is complete, click ‘Finish\' to launch JOSM for the first time.\n    Later, when you want to start JOSM, you can do so by clicking on the\n    Start Menu in the lower left corner of your computer, and clicking\n    the program JOSM.\n-   You may see a window pop up that asks if you want to update the\n    software. You don\'t need to update it since it is new. Press the\n    button that says "Cancel." If you don\'t ever want to see this\n    message again, check the box at the bottom before pressing "Cancel."\n-   When JOSM starts, it will look something like this:\n\n    ![JOSM when it opens ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_opens.png)\n\nChange JOSM Settings\n--------------------\n\n-   Before we begin using JOSM, it\'s a good idea to change some of the\n    settings so that is will be easier to use. To change the settings,\n    click "Edit" on the top menu, and then click "Preferences."\n\n    ![JOSM Preferences ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_preferences.png)\n\n### Add Bing Imagery\n\n-   We want to be able to use satellite imagery when we are making our\n    maps, so let\'s add that from the Preferences window. On the left\n    side of the Preferences window there are different icons for\n    different settings. Click on the icon that says "WMS TMS".\n\n    You may need to click on the down arrow to find it:\n\n-   Click on "Bing Sat". Then Click "Activate".\n\n-   You should now see "Bing Sat" in the list below the Activate button.\n\n### Add Presets\n\n-   If you have been given a file that should be added to the presets\n    menu, you can add it now. For example, the building structure\n    presets file used in Indonesia is called\n    [building.xml](http://www.learnosm.org/files/building.xml).\n-   You should still have the Preferences window open. If you don\'t,\n    click Edit -\\> Preferences to open the window.\n-   On the left side, click the icon that looks like a grid.\n\n-   Click the tab at the top that reads "Tagging Presets".\n-   In the upper right, press the + button.\n-   Next to the second box on the right, click the button that looks\n    like a folder. Navigate to the presets file you want to add, for\n    example, buildings.xml.\n-   Click OK.\n\n### Add Walking Papers Plugin\n\n-   Later in this guide we will learn about a tool called Walking\n    Papers, which will allow us to print out a map of an area, draw on\n    it and take notes, and then load it into JOSM in the background.\n    Then we can add our drawings and our notes into OpenStreetMap. Now\n    we will add the Walking Papers plugin to JOSM.\n-   You should still have the Preferences window open. If you don\'t,\n    click Edit -\\> Preferences to open the window.\n-   On the left side, click the icon that looks like a plug.\n\n-   Click the button that says "Download list". The list will download\n    from the internet, and when it is finished you will see a list of\n    optional plugins appear in the window.\n-   In the search box at the top, type "walking". This will show only\n    items in the list that have "walking" in the title.\n-   Click the checkbox next to the walkingpapers plugin, and press OK at\n    the bottom of the window.\n-   Walking Papers will now be downloaded and installed. Do not click\n    "Cancel".\n\n### Change Language\n\n-   JOSM has been translated into many languages. If it has been\n    translated into your language, you can change it in the Preferences.\n-   If you don\'t have the Preferences window open, click Edit -\\>\n    Preferences.\n-   On the left side, click the icon that looks like a paint can and\n    paint brush.\n-   At the top of the window, click the tab that says "Look and Feel".\n-   Choose your language in the dropdown box next to the word\n    "Language".\n-   Click OK.\n\n-   You need to restart JOSM to save your settings. Click "File" in the\n    upper left corner, and Click "Exit" at the bottom of the menu.\n-   Start JOSM again by going to the Windows Start Menu in the bottom\n    left corner. Find JOSM and click on it to start.\n\nLearn Basic Drawing with JOSM\n-----------------------------\n\n-   Now let\'s open up a sample OSM file which we will use to learn the\n    basic ways to draw maps with JOSM. Note that this map is not real,\n    in that it is not a real map of a real place, so we will not save it\n    on OpenStreetMap.\n-   If you were given a set of files by your instructor, you should\n    already have the file we will open, named sample.osm.\n-   If you don\'t have the file sample.osm, right-click on [this\n    link](http://www.learnosm.org/files/sample.osm) and click "Save Link\n    As…" Choose a location on your computer to save the file.\n-   Now let\'s open the sample map file in JOSM. Open JOSM. Click the\n    "Open" button in the upper left.\n\n-   Find the file sample.osm. Click on it, and then click "Open".\n-   You should now see a sample map, similar to this:\n\n    ![Sample OpenStreetMap File ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/sample_osm_file.png)\n\n### Basic Operations\n\n-   To move the map left or right, up or down, hold your right mouse\n    button down, and move your mouse.\n-   There are several ways to zoom in and out of the map. If you have a\n    mouse, you can use your scroll wheel to zoom in and out. If you are\n    using a laptop and don\'t have a mouse, you can zoom in and out using\n    the scale bar in the upper left of the map window. Drag the bar left\n    and right by holding your left mouse down and moving the bar left or\n    right with your mouse.\n\n-   Look at the sample map. There a few different types of objects here.\n    There is a river, a forest, some buildings, several roads, and a\n    couple of shops. To select an object, click on it with your left\n    mouse button.\n\n### Points, Lines, and Shapes\n\n-   As you click on different objects on the sample map, notice that\n    there are three different types of object on the map. There are\n    points, lines, and shapes.\n-   Points are a single location, represented by symbols. On this sample\n    map, there are two points, a clothing shop and a market. The\n    clothing shop is represented by a shirt symbol, and the market is\n    represented by a shopping cart.\n-   There are several lines on the map as well, which represent roads.\n    If you look closely you will see that within the lines, there are\n    points as well. These points don\'t have any symbols or other\n    information associated with them, but they help to define where the\n    line is located.\n-   Lastly, there are numerous shapes on the sample map, representing\n    different places – a forest, a river, and buildings. A shape\n    generally represents an area, like a field or a building. A shape is\n    exactly like a line – the only difference is that the line begins at\n    the same point where it ends.\n-   You may notice that when you select an object, a list appears to the\n    right of the map in a window called "Properties". These are known as\n    tags. Tags are information that is tied to a point, line or shape\n    that describes what it is. We\'ll learn more about tags in Chapter 7,\n    Advanced Editing. For now all you need to know is that this\n    information helps describe whether our object is a forest, a river,\n    a building, or something else.\n-   Think about drawing a map by hand, and how you are also drawing\n    points, lines, and shapes. What other places are best represented by\n    points? Lines? Shapes?\n\n### Changing Objects\n\n-   Select the forest on the left side of the map. Be sure to click on\n    the line around the forest, not one of the points on the line. Now\n    hold your left mouse button down and drag your mouse. You should be\n    able to move the forest to a new location on the map.\n-   Click on on of the points on the line around the forest. Hold your\n    left mouse button down and drag your mouse. You should be able to\n    move the point. This is how you can change the shape of an object,\n    or move a point.\n\n### Drawing\n\n-   On the left side of a JOSM is a column of buttons. Many of these\n    button open new windows on the right side that provide more\n    information about the map. The most important buttons, however, are\n    at the top of these column. These buttons change what you can do\n    with your mouse.\n-   The top four buttons in this column are the most important. They\n    allow you to:\n\n    -   Select\n    -   Draw\n    -   Zoom in\n    -   Delete\n\n-   Until now, you have been using the Select tool, which looks like\n    this:\n\n-   Before you draw, you need to make sure that nothing is selected.\n    Click in the black space on the map, where it is empty, to make sure\n    nothing is selected.\n-   Click on the second button, the Draw tool.\n\n-   Find an empty area on the map, and double-click with your mouse.\n    This will draw a single point.\n-   To draw a line, single-click with your mouse. Move your mouse and\n    click again. Continue until you are happy with your line. To end the\n    line, double-click your mouse.\n-   Draw a shape the same way that you draw a line, but finish the shape\n    by double-clicking on the point where you started the line.\n\n### Add Presets\n\n-   Now we know how to draw points, lines and shapes, but we still\n    haven\'t defined what they represent. We want to be able to say that\n    our points are shops, schools, or something else, and whether our\n    shapes are fields, buildings, or something else.\n-   Click on the Select tool, in the column of buttons on the left.\n\n-   Select one of the objects that you drew with the Draw tool. On the\n    top menu, click "Presets". Move your mouse through the sub-menu to\n    the type of location you would like to define.\n-   When you click on a preset, a form will pop up asking you for more\n    information. You do not have to fill in every field, but you may\n    wish to add some of the important fields, such as the name of the\n    object.\n-   When you are finished entering the information, click "Apply\n    Preset". If everything went well, your point, line, or shape should\n    change colors or show a symbol. This is because you have defined\n    what it is.\n\n### Draw Your Own Map\n\n-   Now let\'s draw a map in order to practice the techniques you have\n    learned. You may wish to redraw the map that you drew on paper in\n    Chapter 1.\n-   Drag the map away from the sample map. Hold the right mouse button\n    and drag your mouse, until you have a nice empty area to draw on.\n-   Use the Draw tool to create points, lines, and shapes. Describe what\n    your objects are by selecting from the Presets menu.\n-   When you are finished, you should have your own map, similar to the\n    sample map that we opened in sample.osm.\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nExcellent! If all went well you have learned how to setup JOSM on your\ncomputer, and the basic tools for drawing maps. In the next two\nchapters, you will learn how to use GPS and Walking Papers to map your\ntown or village. In Chapter 6, we will return to JOSM and using the\ninformation we collected, we will add objects to OpenStreetMap.\n\nRelated Videos\n--------------\n\n[Setting up JOSM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRqn-S9maL0).\n',
  '0200-12-25-start-osm.md': '---\nlayout: doc\ntitle: Beginning OSM\npermalink: /en/beginner/start-osm\nlang: en\ncategory: beginner\n---\n\nBeginning OSM\n=============\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nIn this chapter we will learn step by step how to navigate the\nOpenStreetMap website, view and print maps, and sign up for a user\naccount. After you have your own username and password, you will be able\nto add your first points to the map.\n\n### Videos Related to this Chapter\n\nWe’ve created two videos that go through the material in this chapter.\nScroll to the bottom to watch these videos.\n\n### Visit the OpenStreetMap Website\n\n-   Be sure that your computer is on and you are connected to the\n    internet.\n-   To visit the OpenStreetMap website, you need to open your web\n    browser. Start your browser – Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or Internet\n    Explorer.\n-   In the address bar at the top of the window, enter the following\n    text: www.openstreetmap.org\n-   When the page has finished loading, you should see something like\n    this:\n\n![OpenStreetMap website with some main functions listed\n]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/osm_website.jpeg)\n\n### Navigate the Map\n\n-   The main thing you should see is the map. Move the map by clicking\n    on it with your left mouse button, holding the button down, and\n    dragging your mouse around (see figure below)\n-   If you have a mouse with a scroll-wheel, zoom in and out on the map\n    by turning the wheel. If you don’t have a scroll-wheel, use the +\n    and – buttons on in the upper right corner of the map. (see figure\n    below)\n-   To search for a place, left-click in the box labelled “Search” on\n    the left side of the page (see figure above). Type in the name of\n    your town or village and press Enter. A window should appear to the\n    left of the map with the results of your search. Click on the\n    location that looks like the one you want. The map will\n    automatically move to the location you chose.\n\n![Mouse navigation ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/mouse.jpeg)\n\n### Save an Image of the Map\n\n-   If you want to save an image from OpenStreetMap that you can easily\n    print, follow these instructions.\n\n![Exporting a map ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/export.jpeg)\n\n-   Just above the map, click on the button labeled “Export”. A new\n    panel will appear next to the map.\n-   In the new window, make sure the button is highlighted next to\n    “Mapnik Image”.\n-   Click “Export” at the bottom of the new window. A download will\n    start. Save it to your computer.\n-   Open the file that you downloaded. If you would like to print the\n    map, you can select “Print” from the File menu, after connected your\n    computer to a printer.\n\n### Create an OpenStreetMap Account\n\n-   Now that you have seen what the main website looks like, you can\n    register for a username and password and make your first additions\n    to the map.\n-   Go back to the OpenStreetMap website. Click “sign up” in the top\n    right corner of the page.\n-   You should see a new page that looks like this:\n\n![Registering an OpenStreetMap Account ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/register.png)\n\n-   There are five boxes on this page that you need to fill in to\n    register an account with OSM.\n-   Enter your email address in the first two boxes. You should enter\n    the same email address in both boxes. Later, you will need to open\n    your email to confirm your account with OpenStreetMap.\n-   In the third box, enter the username that you would like to have.\n    You will not be able to choose a username that someone else has\n    chosen before, so it should be creative. If you try to enter\n    something simple, like your first name, it is likely that someone\n    has already claimed that name.\n-   Enter a new password in the fourth and fifth boxes. You should enter\n    the same password in both boxes. It does not need to be the same as\n    the password for your email.\n-   You will want to remember your user name and your password so that\n    you can login later. You may want to write down your OSM username\n    and password.\n-   After you have completed all the boxes, click “Continue” at the\n    bottom of the page.\n-   If there are any problems, an error message may pop up. Check to\n    make sure that your email is the same in the first to boxes, and\n    your password is the same in the bottom two boxes. If the third box\n    is highlighted red, it means that someone else has already chosen\n    your username, and you should try a different name.\n-   Next you will see a page that displays the contributor terms, which\n    you will need to accept in order to create an OSM account.\n    Basically, the agreement states that you will not add data to\n    OpenStreetMap that is taken from other maps, unless you have clear\n    permission to do so. The agreement also states how your\n    contributions to OSM may be used. Data entered into OSM has what is\n    called a Creative Commons license, which essentially means that\n    anyone can use the data as they like, but they can’t take the data\n    and claim it as their own.\n\n![Contributor Terms ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/terms.png)\n\n-   You have the option of declaring your additions to OpenStreetMap as\n    public domain, which means that anyone can do absolutely anything\n    they want with your data, with no restrictions whatsoever. If you\n    would like to make your edits public domain, click the checkbox at\n    the bottom of the page next to “Public Domain”.\n-   To accept the agreement, click “Agree” at the bottom of the page.\n-   Open a separate window or tab in your internet browser, and navigate\n    to your email. Common email sites are mail.yahoo.com and\n    www.gmail.com.\n-   Enter your email address and your email password to open your email.\n    Note that this is not the same as your OpenStreetMap username and\n    password.\n-   If everything was successful with your registration, you should see\n    an email from OpenStreetMap in your inbox. Open the email. It should\n    look like the image below. Click on the link that is identified\n    below:\n\n![Confirming your OpenStreetMap account ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/confirm.png)\n\n-   A new tab or window will open. If everything went well, you should\n    have an OSM account!\n-   On the OpenStreetMap page, click “log in” in the top right corner.\n    Enter your OpenStreetMap username and password and press Enter. You\n    should now be logged in. You should see your username in the upper\n    right corner of the page.\n-   If this is your first time logging in, you will see a page where you\n    can change your profil settings. You may edit this if you want, but\n    you don’t have to. To return to the map, click on the “View” tab at\n    the top of the page.\n\n### Adding Your First Points\n\n-   Now that you are logged in with your username on the OpenStreetMap\n    website, you can use the Potlatch editor to add your first point to\n    the map.\n-   In order to use the online editor, you must have Adobe Flash\n    installed in your browser. If its not installed you will see an\n    error when you try to edit. If this happens, go to\n    [http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer)/\n    and follow the instructions to install Flash. If you don’t want to\n    go through the trouble of installing Flash or using Potlatch to\n    edit, you may skip ahead to the next chapter, where we will discuss\n    the desktop editor called JOSM.\n-   Move the map to a place that you know very well, such as your town\n    or village.\n-   Zoom in to a place where you would like to add a point to the map.\n\n![Start editing ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/editing.jpeg)\n\n-   Just above the map on the left, there is a tab marked “Edit”. Hover\n    your mouse over this button, but don’t click. You should see a menu\n    drop down.\n-   Click “Edit with Potlatch 2 (in-browser editor).\n-   The online editor for OpenStreetMap should open. If a window pops\n    up, press “OK”\n\n![Editing with in-browser editor ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/editing_browser.jpeg)\n\n-   You can add a point to the map by clicking on an icon on the left,\n    and dragging it to its location on the map. After you add the point\n    and are satisfied that it is correct, click “Save” in the upper\n    right corner.\n-   When you click “Save” your edits will be saved to OpenStreetMap.\n    Return to the main OpenStreetMap page by clicking on the “View” tab\n    at the top of your browser. You should now see any edits that you\n    have made on the map. If you don’t see your edits, try refreshing\n    the page by pressing CTRL+r on your keyboard. Sometimes it takes up\n    to 5 minutes for changes to be added to the map, so don’t worry if\n    you don’t see your changes right away!\n-   NOTE: If you are not sure about the accuracy of the point(s) you\n    add, don’t click “Save”! Play around with the Potlatch editor, but\n    don’t save your changes.\n\n### Summary\n\nCongratulations! If all went well you now have an OpenStreetMap username\nand password, you know how to navigate the OSM website, and you have\nyour first understanding of how to add points to the map.In the next\nchapter, we will install a desktop editor for OpenStreetMap, called\nJOSM, and learn how to draw maps and add places with symbols to the map.\nGo to Chapter 3 – Getting Started with JOSM\n\n### Related Videos\n\n[Getting Started](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qKaL9IGjk/)\n\n[Signing Up and Making Your First\nEdits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXDWxGUp8N0/)\n',
  '0200-12-30-introduction.md': '---\nlayout: doc\ntitle: Introduction\npermalink: /en/beginner/introduction\nlang: en\ncategory: beginner\n---\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nInformation is powerful. With good information and the right\nunderstanding, individuals and communities are better able to improve\ntheir lives and make good decisions about the future. There are many\npeople and organizations who make decisions that affect our lives. Good\ninformation allows these NGOs, governments and citizens to make better\ndecisions, and hopefully make our lives better. Maps can be a good way\nto convey information. Maps are visual symbols of our world. They can\noften demonstrate an idea better than words. This in turn can also help\nanswer important questions. Where is the closest school or hospital? Who\nhas the least access to these facilities? Where is poverty the most\nproblematic? Questions like these can often best be expressed with maps,\nand maps can help find solutions to these questions. As an exercise, get\na pen and paper and draw a map of your town or village. What are the\nmost important things to include on the map? What is the most important\ninformation? Spend a few minutes making your map, and when you’re\nfinished, think about why the information you included is important, and\nwho it might be important to.\n\n![A village in Indonesia ][]\n\n![Example of a Hand-drawn Map ][]\n\nIf your town is like most, you may have drawn some lines to represent\nroads, possibly a river or stream. Perhaps you added important buildings\nsuch as schools and offices, fields, or boundaries. Whatever you drew,\nyou probably used symbols – a line to symbolize a road, a square to\nsymbolize a building, and so on. Your map is a representation of what is\non the ground.\n\n![Examples of Symbols ][]\n\nYour map is informative. You might use a map like this to explain to\nsomeone where different places are, where problems are in your\ncommunity, or merely to help someone find their way around. The uses of\nyour map is limited though. There is only one copy of the map and the\nway you drew it may make sense to you, but perhaps not to someone else\nwho would have drawn their own map in a different way. Because your map\nis merely on paper, it is difficult to get that information to others.\nThis is why making your map on a computer, in such a way that anyone can\naccess it, can be much more valuable. OpenStreetMap is a tool for\ncreating and sharing map information. Anyone can contribute to OSM, and\nthousands of people add to the project every day. Users draw maps on\ncomputers, rather than paper, but as we will see in this guide, drawing\na map on a computer is not all that different from drawing on paper. We\nstill draw lines to represent roads, fields, and anything else, and we\nstill represent schools and hospitals with symbols. The important thing\nis that OSM maps are saved on the internet, and anyone can access them\nat any time, totally free.\n\n![Digital Maps with OpenStreetMap ][]\n\nWe hope that you will find OpenStreetMap useful and interesting in your\nwork. By following this guide, you should be able to quickly start\nmaking digital maps and adding to OSM.\n\n[A village in Indonesia ]: {{site.baseurl}}/images/en/vill1.jpg\n[Example of a Hand-drawn Map ]: {{site.baseurl}}/images/en/drawing.gif\n[Examples of Symbols ]: {{site.baseurl}}/images/en/symb.jpg\n[Digital Maps with OpenStreetMap ]: {{site.baseurl}}/images/en/osm1.png\n' }
