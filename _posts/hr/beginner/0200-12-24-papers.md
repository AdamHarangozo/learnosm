Izmjera pomoću Field Papers-a
=============================

U ovom poglavlju vidjet ćemo kako zabilježiti lokaciju objekata bez GPS-a.
Koristiti ćemo alat zvan [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/), 
koji omogućuje da printaš karte područja, crtaš po njima i radiš zabilješke, 
učitaš papir nazad u JOSM, gdje možeš dodati svoje lokacije u OpenStreetMap.

Pregled Field Papers-a
----------------------

Prije nego pređemo na detalje, pogledajmo pregled kako proces funkcionira:

1. Lociraj područje koje želiš mapirati na Field Papers web stranici.
Isprintaj kartu tog područja. Možeš odabrati ispis željene karte na 
OpenStreetMap podlozi, ili možeš izabrati ispis na satelitskim podlogama, 
ako su dostupne za to područje.

![field papers homepage][]

2. Koristi svoju prinatanu kartu za izmjeru terena. Dodaj nova mjesta
crtajući ih na kartu. Nacrtaj linije za ceste, oblike za zgrade, itd.
Napiši zabilješke o svakoj lokaciji direktno na kartu, ili brojeve na kartu 
i poveži ih sa brojevima koje imaš na drugom papiru, 
gdje možeš detaljno opisati svaki objekt.

![paper example][]

3. Skeniraj svoj papir na računalo. Ako nemaš skener, 
uslikaj fotografiju papira, ako je fotoaparat dovoljno kvalitetan.
Pošalji sliku na internet putem Field Papers web stranice.

4. U JOSM-u, učitaj Field Papers. Koristi objekte koje si nacrtao 
kao podlogu da bi ih digitalno nacrtao u OpenStreetMap.

Kako radi Field Papers?
-----------------------

Ako sljediš Field Papers postupak opisan maloprije, moći ćeš 
skupljati precizne geografske koordinate objekata samo sa papirom i olovkom.
Kako je to moguće?

![paper QR code][]

Kad printaš Field Papers, papir dolazi sa kvadratnim bar kodom na dnu stranice.
Taj bar kod omogućava da Field Papers odredi točnu poziciju karte koju koristiš.
kasnije, kad učitavaš taj papir u JOSM, svi objekti koje si nacrtao bit će 
prikazani na svojim pravim pozicijama. To je kao korištenje GPS-a za skupljanje 
preciznih koordinata, osim što koristiš samo papir i olovku!

Idemo naučiti kako kreirati i koristiti Field Papers.

Kreiraj i Printaj
-----------------

-   Open your web browser. In the address bar at the top of the window,
    enter the following text and press Enter:
    [fieldpapers.org](http://fieldpapers.org)
-   The website should look something like this:

![field papers homepage][]

-   Click **Make yourself an Atlas** to select the area you want to print out.

![makeatlas][]
	
-   You will be directed to this page:
	
![atlas][]
	
-	Type the name of your area of interest in the space provided. Then
    click "Start there".

-   The map that you see shows the area that you would like to print on
    paper. You can move the map the same way you move the map on the
    OpenStreetMap website, using your left mouse button to drag the map,
    and your scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
    Left-clicking on the (+) and (–) buttons in the upper left corner will
    also zoom in and out.
	
![zoominout][]
	
-   Just above the map are some additional options. The first option is
    to select the orientation of the paper you want to use for printing the
	Field Paper. You may choose either portrait or landscape.
	
![choosetile][]
	
-   The next option lets you select the kind of data you want to use
    for your Field Paper. Here you can select from different options
	that will change how the map looks. For now, we will select
	**Black and White**.

![blackandwhite][]
	
-   You want to make sure that the window shows the area that you want to
    map. You can use the controls in the map window to resize the pages of
    your Field Paper, or to more or fewer pages. Be sure that you papers cover
    a reasonably small area, or they won't be of much use when you are walking
    around. If you make mistakes the first time, don't worry, you can create
    as many papers as you need.
-   Let's make the print now! If you have found the area you are
    interested in mapping and have selected the options that make your
    paper look good, you are ready. Click the button labelled "Next",
    next to the dropdown box.
	
![labelnext][]
	
-	Provide a name for the paper. If you like, you can add text which will appear
    on each paper that is printed.

![name][]
	
-	The next option lets you select a layout. It comes with three options.
	You may add a UTM grid overlay to each map if you want to. In most cases,
    you can select "Maps Only," which is already selected by default.
	
![layout][]
	
-   Click "Finished!"
-   You will see that your new print is being
    processed. When it is finished, you will see your Field Paper on this
    page. It usually only take a few minutes for a print to be ready, depending
    on how many pages you are creating.

![preparing your atlas][]

-   When your print is ready, click "Download map PDF for print". The
    Field Paper should begin downloading.
	
![downloadpdf][]
	
-   When the download is finished, open the PDF file. Connect your
    computer to a printer and print the page. If everything goes well,
    you should now have your map printed on paper.

Map with Field Papers
-----------------------

-   Take your Field Paper outside, and use it as a guide to walk and
    identify new places that are not on the map.
-   Draw lines for roads, shapes for buildings, and so forth. Write
    notes about each location directly on the map, or write numbers on
    the map that relate to numbers in your notebook, where you can write
    more detailed information about each object.
-   When you are satisfied with your additions on the paper map, then
    you can add them digitally into OpenStreetMap.

Scan and Upload
---------------

-   Field Papers are very useful for mapping with nothing more than
    paper, but they are not 100% magic. We will still need to add our
    paper into JOSM, add our information digitally, and save our changes
    on OpenStreetMap.
-   The first step is to scan your Field Papers into your computer. You
    can do this by attaching a scanner to your computer, scanning the
    paper, and saving it as an image file. If you don't have a scanner,
    you can take a photograph of the paper, but you should be careful
    to take a very good photo. Make sure that the paper is flat and your
    camera is directly in front of it. Be sure to include the barcode in
    the image, as Field Papers will not work without it. Here is an
    example of a scanned/photographed image:


![scrnsht][]


-   Once you have your Field Paper scanned and saved on the computer,
    open your web browser and return to fieldpapers.org, just as
    before.
-   Click on the "Upload" tab.

![upload][]
	
-   Click "Choose File" and navigate to the file where you
    scanned/photographed your Field Papers.
	

![uploadfp][]

	
-   Click "Upload"
-   It may take a few minutes for your paper to upload, depending on the
    speed of your internet connection. When the upload finishes, you will
	see something like this:

![paper upload 2][]

Add the Field Papers Plugin
---------------------------
-   Before we can open the Field Paper in JOSM, we need to install the
    JOSM Field Papers plugin.

>   Plugins add additional functionality to JOSM. The Field Papers plugin
>   allows us to load our scanned paper as a background, the same way we
>   can see satellite imagery as a background.

<!-- link to josm plugins section here -->

-   Open JOSM and go to Edit -> Preferences.
-   Click on the Plugins tab.
-   Find the Field Papers plugin and check the box next to it. Click OK.

![field papers plugin][]

-   Restart JOSM.

Open in JOSM
------------

-   Now can load your Field Paper into JOSM and use it to add the
    information you collected to OpenStreetMap. Return to the
    Field Papers website, by typing
    [fieldpapers.org](http://fieldpapers.org/) in your web
    browser, just as before.
-   Click the "Watch" tab and then click "Snapshots."
-   Find your paper from the list, and click on it. You should see
    something like this:

![paper scanned][]

-   To load the paper into JOSM, we need to copy the snapshot ID of the Field
    Papers you have scanned. In the URL bar at the top of your internet
    browser, select the text and press CTRL+C on your keyboard to copy.
    The text should look similar to this:
    [http://fieldpapers.org/snapshot.php?id=zqw8m33x#16/14.6582/121.1098](http://fieldpapers.org/snapshot.php?id=zqw8m33x#16/14.6582/121.1098)
	
![fieldpaperid][]
	
-   On the top menu of JOSM, Click "Field Papers". Then click "Scanned
    Map..."
	
![scannedmap][]
	
-   Press CTRL+V on your keyboard to paste the text that you copied from
    the Field Papers website.
	
![fsnapshot][]
	
-   Click OK.
-   If all went well, you should see your Field Paper load into JOSM.
    In the next chapter, we will see how to add the places that you
    mapped into OpenStreetMap.

![fieldpaperjosm][]

You can also use your scanned Field Papers in other OSM online editors 
such as iD or Potlatch2 by clicking the "Edit in iD" or "Edit in Potlatch"
links in the scanned Field Papers page. 

![editinidorpot][]

![paper in id][]
	
Repeat!
-------

-   After you add your changes to OSM, they will be saved on the
    map. Then the next time you want to improve the map, you can print
    out a new Field Papers which will include the changes that you
    made. As this process is repeated, the map will get better and
    better, the more you map!

Summary
-------

Congratulations! In this chapter you learned the process of using
Field Papers and how they work. You learned how to print, map, and
scan a Field Paper, and how you can use them to improve OpenStreetMap.
