"Drawing maps in Chapter 3 was an exercise to learn JOSM and learn how to "

"Information is powerful. With good information and the right understanding, "
"individuals and communities are better able to improve their lives and make "
"good decisions about the future. There are many people and organizations who "
"make decisions that affect our lives. Good information allows these NGOs, "
"governments and citizens to make better decisions, and hopefully make our "
"lives better. Maps can be a good way to convey information. Maps are visual "
"symbols of our world. They can often demonstrate an idea better than words. "
"This in turn can also help answer important questions. Where is the closest "
"school or hospital? Who has the least access to these facilities? Where is "
"poverty the most problematic? Questions like these can often best be "
"expressed with maps, and maps can help find solutions to these questions. As "
"an exercise, get a pen and paper and draw a map of your town or village. "
"What are the most important things to include on the map? What is the most "
"important information? Spend a few minutes making your map, and when you're "
"finished, think about why the information you included is important, and who "
"it might be important to."

"If your town is like most, you may have drawn some lines to represent roads, "

"Your map is informative. You might use a map like this to explain to someone "
"where different places are, where problems are in your community, or merely "
"to help someone find their way around. The uses of your map is limited "
"though. There is only one copy of the map and the way you drew it may make "
"sense to you, but perhaps not to someone else who would have drawn their own "
"map in a different way. Because your map is merely on paper, it is difficult "
"to get that information to others. This is why making your map on a "
"computer, in such a way that anyone can access it, can be much more "
"valuable. OpenStreetMap is a tool for creating and sharing map information. "
"Anyone can contribute to OSM, and thousands of people add to the project "
"every day. Users draw maps on computers, rather than paper, but as we will "
"see in this guide, drawing a map on a computer is not all that different "
"from drawing on paper. We still draw lines to represent roads, fields, and "
"anything else, and we still represent schools and hospitals with symbols. "
"The important thing is that OSM maps are saved on the internet, and anyone "
"can access them at any time, totally free."
